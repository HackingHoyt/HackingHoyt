- 👋 Hi, I’m @HackingHoyt
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about A.I.
- 🌱 I’m Just getting started on A.I. with a Udemy class. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something simple in A.I. for learning purposes.
- 📫 How to reach me @hackinghoyt.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I studied to be a software engineer. I went to Kenzie academy and graduated with a 91% in july 2020. I have done nothing with my new skills(job wise or much else)
- I got chatGPT and see what can be done with it and I amazed and excited to learn more!
